### An Update

What's up guys.

As I mentioned in my [2022 Review](https://defibuilder.eth.limo/q4-2022-review), this blog is back in action largely due to finding an orders of magnitude better solution for hosting the blog, in [Fleek.co](https://fleek.co/).

It wasn't without it's difficulties - I essentially had to rip out ghost from the backend and go to a vanilla gatsby blog setup. I used the minimal-blog template, which you can find [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) if you like it. 

But it's a huge step forward for a bunch of reasons.

1. A generous free tier.

While the previous solution Pinata was fine (it was actually their support team that put me on to fleek), a personal blog on fleek falls well within the free tier (which includes 250m of build time and 50GB bandwidth). Bear market is biting too hard for me to shell out $20/month :D

2. Much streamlined build process.

With the old setup, I'd finish a blog post in the ghost editor, run the build command locally, upload the file to IPFS through Pinata, pin it, get the CDN then update my ENS content record with that CDN.

Looooooootta friction.

With fleek, I write markdown files in VSCode (that might sound intimidating but it is actually not at all hard), commit and push the changes to github, and that's it. This triggers the CI/CD pipeline on fleek, and the changes will be live within a few minutes. 

Numerous dollars and minutes saved per update, which obviously makes me fell much more positively inclined towards doing them!

3. Amazing support

I had some mild bother deploying to fleek, as my gatsby theme required a newer version of Node than the default. I got on [their Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fleekxyz) where support walked me through the troubleshooting process literally within minutes. 

Feel like I'm shilling them now lol, but there is no affiliate link, just credit where credit is due.

Don't need to make this post unnecessarily long, just felt that since I'm claiming to have the ultimate guide here, I had better let you all know when such a drastic improvement comes along.

GL out there, keep building!
