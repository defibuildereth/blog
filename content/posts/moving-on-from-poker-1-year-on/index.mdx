I ran into a friend/ex-student in a pub the other night, and he asked me if I wasn't missing playing poker - having thought about it there's stuff I miss and stuff I don't.

### 1. For a long time, I really missed the feeling of giving my absolute best to something and of doing a thing truly well. 

When I was playing poker, even till what turned out to be the last days, I really enjoyed the security of knowing that if I ticked off the things I needed to tick off (reviewing hands, playing hands, being deliberate about mental game etc), I could go to sleep knowing that I'd done what I needed to do to move myself closer to the top of the heap. After taking the big leap and starting from the bottom of a different, much more massive mountain, I struggled a little with the feeling that I'd made a mistake, that I was wasting my time down the wrong rabbit hole, and most of all about not being confident that the plan I'd made would deliver the results I hoped for.

### 2. I miss the $ :D 

Now that the work I do is basically paid in future equity or in crypto, I'm in a lame situation where when I want to pay for stuff (like a wedding..), I basically have to sell crypto I don't want to sell to pay for it. I'm obviously not suddenly poor, but I am kinda broke in a way I'm not very used to after years of being very liquid/actively adding to savings rather than eating into them.

That said though, this was always going to happen - you can’t move from near the top of one profession to the absolute bottom of another without your monthly earnings taking a substantial dip. I guess the decision to move on from poker was made almost instinctively/by accident, such that I didn’t really plan out/appreciate that this would happen. Whether or not the decision ultimately pays off is (a lot like poker) basically 100% up to me in the long run, and now that I’ve started to get a little traction I’m confident that it will.

### 3. I miss the boys

Though things are starting to change now, I started this journey completely on my own (much like I did with poker) and that really took some getting used to. It’s another thing I didn’t really think about at the time, but I definitely miss jumping on/hosting study calls a few times a week and talking spots/regs/whatever with my poker friends. It’s weird because I feel like I’ve kinda lost the main thing I had in common with basically all the best friends I’ve made since I left school - I’d love to just get the crack with everyone every now and then, and I guess I still could, I’ve just kinda lost that pretext for initiating.

### 4. I’m enjoying building 

Though I enjoyed playing a poker a lot, one of the things I didn’t like about it was the every month/session/hand, you essentially start again from 0. With the stuff I’m doing now, the things I’m doing today build on the things I did yesterday (or a month ago, or both), which gives a nice feeling of semi-steady progression, more like a hobby in terms of the dopamine payoff structure than poker, where sometimes it’s easy to feel like you’re going backwards.

### 5. I’m enjoying variety 

Obviously related to above, but the cool thing about programming is that once you’ve solved a problem, it essentially stays solved such that you don’t have to solve it again, or if you do you can do it in a fraction of the time.

Poker was great to me - it allowed me to live a fantastic life, see a lot of the world, and remain in charge of myself and my time throughout my twenties, which is a thing very few people manage to achieve. I learned analytical and counter-factual reasoning skills that will serve me well for the rest of my professional life, plus a framework for creating emotional coping strategies that I continue to use daily. I think that learning to play poker, even in 2022, is one of the best ways to get from 4-5 figure to 7 figure net worth, though it might be a quite poor way to get from 7 to 8+.

Though I'd never rule out returning to the streets, at this point I think it's quite unlikely - I have a fairly long (and growing) list of ideas I'd like to pursue relating to coding and crypto, and while that remains the case I don't think I'll go back to playing poker full time. Even a part time return is unlikely, as I know it would be harder to lose money while being aware that I've been playing and studying considerably less than all my opponents in the last year.

So - we continue down the rabbit hole.

Keep building and GL out there!
