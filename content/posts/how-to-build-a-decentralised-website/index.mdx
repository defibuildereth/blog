How to Build a Decentralised Website - the Ultimate Guide:

1. Understanding decentralisation
2. Understanding blockchains and funding (via tornado.cash)
3. Decentralised domain and hosting (via the Ethereum Name Service aka ENS and IPFS aka the InterPlanetary File System)
4. Full walkthrough: Building a website on ENS


What's up guys.

Seeing the situation with the Canadian truckers and the weaponisation of the financial system got me thinking. I highly encourage you to read @punk6529's thread in full if you haven't already. Though it sounds suspiciously like the ravings of a conspiracy theorist, given that the technological tools exist for governments to censor the free speech of public figures (using web2 tools as their platform), it is perhaps just a matter of time until a meaningful amount of well-intentioned people are looking for a complete guide on how to share their thoughts with the world on a censorship resistant platform. I say a matter of time, but I'm sure a substantial proportion of people would argue that the de-platforming of Alex Jones in 2018 was a landmark moment in terms of web2 companies, at the behest of the government, acting in concert to drastically limit the reach of a popular but controversial figure.

So here it is - the ultimate guide on how to build a decentralised website using ENS.

### Can a Website be Censored?
To understand what we're going to build, we first have to understand the mechanics by which websites are censored. Normally, when you register a domain name, you are required by law to provide information such as your name and address, plus some means of payment. If the content on the website is considered to be in violation of the law, the government will order the business you used to register the domain (GoDaddy, HostGator, NameCheap etc) to take down the content, or take down the website altogether.

On the large web2 platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook etc the censorship process is more simple to execute and more extensively used. Concerningly, it's also not necessarily beholden to any law - if you share or produce content which is against the stated terms of the site, your right to use the platform will simply be removed. Several web2 companies have come under fire for applying their rules in an inconsistent, some would say arbitrary way, de-platforming people for their views or their politics, in direct contradiction with the first amendment.

### What Is a Censorship Resistant Website?
A censorship resistant website is one which is robust to the methods by which government agencies (or large web2 companies) would seek to take down content. The key to creating one is to use infrastructure which is decentralised rather than centralised.

### What do you Mean by Decentralisation?
Decentralisation is a much used, often misunderstood term. A service is decentralised if there is no one authority with the power to withhold the right to use the service from any given customer. Public blockchains are a good example of this - it is practically impossible for any authority to remove someone's right to transact on the Bitcoin network, as was beautifully expressed by Nunchuk in response to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.
