What's up guys.

I've finally finished up my tax return for the year, so I'm both broke and available to work :D

Here's what I can do for you/your project:

- Automated Content Marketing

Every time something significant happens on the blockchain, there's an opportunity to broadcast it to those people who are interested. Don't hire a social media team, just hire me once and put the whole thing on autopilot. Example [here](https://twitter.com/whalezigzag).

- Blockchain Analytics

I can combine historical and live data from multiple sources and display it clearly. Check out [zigzagstats.com](https://www.zigzagstats.com/) and [zkscanalyzer.com](https://www.zkscanalyzer.com/).

- On-chain Bots

More recently, I've been building bots that listen for and respond to opportunities on-chain. If you're looking for someone to automate a trading strategy on-chain, I can help. 

- Anything Else

After close to 2 years building full stack web apps, bots and automating all kinds of workflows, I feel confident enough to take on whatever you want to throw at me.

If I can be of service to you, reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DefiBuilderETH)/Discord (DefiBuilder.eth#9743) or email defibuildereth@gmail.com. 

Cheers!
