What's up guys.

Lately, I've been feeling like as I go further down the crypto/coding rabbit hole, the opportunity space is growing far faster than I can keep up with. Between BowTiedDevil's excellent [intro to MEV](https://degencode.substack.com/p/start-here), the constant stream of innovation around ChatGPT/OpenAI and the [new defi primitives](https://app.pendle.finance/pro/markets/0x7d49e5adc0eaad9c027857767638613253ef125f) popping up left and right, it's easy to feel overwhelmed with the massive opportunity space. 

Partly inspired by Jordan O'Connor's excellent recent article about [limiting your options](https://jdnoc.com/cut-it-off/), I've decided to share a mental model I've been using to quickly rule out certain classes of opportunity.
