Hello world.

I'm a long time pro poker player turned crypto enthusiast (that old cliche). My goal with this blog is to share tips, tools and resources as I try to 10-100x my defi building skills in 2022, while making defi products more accessible to newcomers with walkthroughs and guides.

If you want to hear from me when I publish stuff, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/defibuildereth) (DefiBuilderETH). If you want to hire me or contact me about anything else,  you can email me at defibuildereth@gmail.com

GL out there!
